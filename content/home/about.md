# Biography

I am a resaearcher and PhD student in the Institute of Computer Science at Heidelberg University.
My research interests cover the wide intersection between performance engineering and software engineering related topics, including 
performance testing, adaptive data structures and algorithms, mining software repositories.

I am particularly interested in materializing empirical software engineering results into tools and approaches that minimize the burden
of developers in regarding to performance optimization.

Born in Brazil, I have received my Bsc and Msc at the Federal University of Uberlandia.
