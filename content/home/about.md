# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Concordia University, working at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering in the [DAS Lab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/) of Prof. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/). Before that, I was doing my PhD at Heidelberg University, in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/) of [Prof. Andrzejak](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aa/). 

My research is focused on software engineering and performance engineering related topics, including 
adaptive data structures and algorithms, performance testing, mining software repositories, API recommendation and memory leak detection.
I am particularly interested in materializing empirical results into tools and approaches that minimize the 
burden of developers in performance related tasks.

Born in Brazil, I have received my Bachelor and Master of Science degrees at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.
