# Biography

I am a researcher and PhD student at Heidelberg University, working at the Institute of Computer Science 
in the Parallel and Distributed Systems Group of Prof. Andrzejak. 

My research is focused on software engineering and performance engineering related topics, including 
adaptive data structures and algorithms, performance testing, mining software repositories, API recommendation and memory leak detection.
I am particularly interested in materializing empirical results into tools and approaches that minimize the 
burden of developers in performance related tasks.

Born in Brazil, I have received my Bachelor and Master of Science degree at the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.
